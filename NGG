# To create a guessing game, we need to write a program to select a random number between 1 and 10. To give hints to the user, we
# can use conditional statements to tell the user if the guessed number is smaller, greater than or equal to the randomly selected
# number.

# So below is how you can write a program to create a number guessing game using Python:
import random
n = random.randrange(1,10)
guess = int(input("Enter any number: "))
while n!= guess:
    if guess < n:
        print("Too low")
        guess = int(input("Enter number again: "))
    elif guess > n:
        print("Too high!")
        guess = int(input("Enter number again: "))
    else:
      break
print("you guessed it right!!")

# If the guessed number is lower than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too low”. If the guessed number is higher 
# than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too high”. When the user guesses the correct number, “you guessed it 
# right!!” will be displayed in the output.

# Summary
# So this is how you can write a program to create a guessing game using Python. It is a popular game among programmers. In this 
# game, the program selects a random number between two numbers, and the user guesses the correct number. I hope you liked this
